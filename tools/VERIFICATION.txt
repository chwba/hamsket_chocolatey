How to verify the SHA256 checksum of hamsket_setup.exe in Powershell?

$file = "hamsket_setup.exe"
Write-Host $file
$sha256 = get-filehash $file -Algorithm SHA256  | select -ExpandProperty "Hash"
Write-Host $sha256

The checksum of the included setup executable is: DA8EB4EEC6558AD229A5955787E5E1786A42DB78C467E66E27C22B57C3A0AA91
It was downloaded from http://github.com/TheGoddessInari/hamsket/releases/download/nightly/Hamsket.Setup.0.6.0.exe on 2020-11-05.

As the software maintainer, always replaces the nightly releases without realease numbering, I have enclosed
the source code for the user in hamsket_source.zip to build the exe and verify the checksum of the generated setup theirselves as well.
